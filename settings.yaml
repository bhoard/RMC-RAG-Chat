# Simple RAG Pipeline Configuration
# All scripts will read settings from this file
# DO NOT commit sensitive data to this file if making repo public

# Website Configuration
site:
  sitemap_url: "https://www.rmc.edu/sitemap.xml"  # Change this to your sitemap URL
  user_agent: "SimpleRAGBot/1.0 (+https://github.com/yourusername/simple-rag-pipeline)"
  
# Database Configuration
database:
  crawl_ledger: "crawl_ledger.db"  # stores URLs and raw content
  chunks: "chunks.db"  # stores processed chunks for RAG
  embeddings: "embeddings.db"  # stores vector embeddings

# Crawl4AI Configuration
crawler:
  timeout: 30  # seconds
  max_retries: 3
  delay_between_requests: 1  # seconds to be polite between requests
  batch_size: 200  # number of pages to crawl per run (0 = all pending pages)
  recrawl_after_days: 30  # recrawl successfully crawled pages after this many days
  
  # URL patterns to ignore (supports wildcards)
  ignore_patterns:
    - "/wp-content/" # Ignore PDFs, images, svgs and so forth
    - "/events/" # Ignore TEC events listing
    - "/event/" # Ignore TEC individual events
    - "/venues/" # More TEC
    - "/organizer/" # More TEC
    - "/news-tag/" # News Meta 
    - "/wp-admin/" # Ignore all WP admin pages
    - "/admin/*"  # Ignore all admin pages
    - "/login"    # Ignore specific page
    - "*/print/*" # Ignore print versions
    # Add more patterns as needed
  
# Processing Configuration
processing:
  chunk_size: 500  # target characters per chunk
  chunk_overlap: 50  # character overlap between chunks
  min_chunk_size: 100  # minimum chunk size (skip smaller chunks)
  respect_sentences: true  # try to break at sentence boundaries
  respect_paragraphs: true  # try to keep paragraphs together when possible
  
# Embedding Configuration
embeddings:
  model: "all-mpnet-base-v2"  # sentence-transformers model name
  dimension: 768  # embedding dimension for the model above
  batch_size: 100  # number of chunks to embed per run (0 = all pending)
  processing_batch: 32  # chunks to process together in model (for efficiency)
  
  # Alternative models you can use:
  # - "all-MiniLM-L6-v2" (384 dim) - Fast, good quality
  # - "all-mpnet-base-v2" (768 dim) - Better quality, slower
  # - "BAAI/bge-small-en-v1.5" (384 dim) - Good for retrieval
  # - "BAAI/bge-base-en-v1.5" (768 dim) - Better for retrieval
